#### State Machine Flow
SELECT → PREP → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → MERGE → PUSH → DONE
With error transitions: IMPLEMENT/VERIFY → ERROR_SOLVE → VERIFY or HUMAN_REVIEW

### Workflow Categories Identified

   - Resource allocation monitoring
   - Completion notifications and reporting

3. **Administrator (admin) Workflows**:
   - System configuration and maintenance
   - User management and permissions
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

### Technical Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React 18, Redux Toolkit, styled-components, WebSocket integration
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket server, Docker orchestration
- **AI Tools**: Containerized Aider, Claude Code, Ollama with intelligent routing
- **Database**: Enhanced CRM database with execution state management
- **Security**: Customer execution isolation, encrypted tokens, audit trails

### Implementation Status
- Current focus: DevTeam extension (autonomous execution engine)
- Existing CRM functionality: Customer management, project tracking, financial integration
- Integration points: TaskList.jsx, Redux state management, existing API patterns

### Next Steps
1. Examine existing codebase implementation
2. Map current workflows vs. planned autonomous workflows
3. Create detailed workflow diagrams with mermaid syntax
4. Document integration points and dependencies
5. Create comprehensive workflow documentation files

## Workflow Relationship Mapping

### Dependencies Identified
- Autonomous execution depends on existing task management system
- Multi-customer dashboard extends existing CRM interface
- AI tool integration requires Docker infrastructure
- Real-time updates require WebSocket implementation
- Error resolution integrates with existing notification system

### Integration Points
- src/components/tasks/TaskList.jsx - Base component for multi-customer view
- Redux store - State management for execution states
- Existing API patterns - Authentication and data access
- Docker infrastructure - AI tool containerization
- GitHub integration - Repository management and task parsing

## Mermaid Diagram Planning

### Syntax Constraints
- NO PARENTHESES in any node labels or descriptions
- Use clear, descriptive labels without special characters
- Consistent node shapes and colors for similar actions
- Include error paths and decision points
- Mark role indicators where applicable

### Planned Diagrams
1. Autonomous Execution State Machine
2. Multi-Customer Dashboard Workflow
3. AI Tool Selection and Routing
4. Error Resolution and Escalation
5. Repository Management and Sync
6. Real-Time Communication Flow
7. User Role-Based Workflows
8. Quality Assurance and Verification

## UPDATED VISION - AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION ENGINE ✅

### Key Clarifications from User:
1. **Multi-Customer Parallel Processing**: Each customer has ≥1 project with GitHub repo containing `task_lists.md`
2. **Autonomous Progression**: System automatically progresses through tasks without developer intervention
3. **Continuous Execution**: Developer selects customer/project, initializes execution, system runs autonomously
4. **Error Resolution Integration**: Automatic error-solving workflow when tasks fail
5. **Asynchronous Multi-Customer Support**: Multiple customers can have task executions running simultaneously
6. **Progress Monitoring**: Developers can check progress when returning to client task panels
7. **Optional Stop Points**: Developer can delegate stop after specific task (e.g., task x.x.x.x)

### Core Workflow Components Identified:
- **Repository Initialization**: Ensure local repo setup and runner availability
- **Task Selection & Execution**: Automatic progression through task_lists.md
- **Success/Error Verification**: Automated validation of task completion
- **Error Resolution**: Integrated error-solving workflow for failed tasks
- **Task List Updates**: Automatic updates to task_lists.md file
- **Multi-Customer Orchestration**: Parallel execution management
- **Progress Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface

## TaskList Component Analysis ✅

### Current Implementation (src/components/tasks/TaskList.jsx - 575 lines):
- **Integration Point**: Lines 77-91 (Start Timer Button) - Perfect location for "Automate Project" button
- **Component Structure**:
  - TaskItem component (lines 15-241) - Individual task display with expand/collapse
  - TaskSection component (lines 265-325) - Groups tasks by status (Active/Completed)
  - Main TaskList component (lines 344-575) - Orchestrates task management
- **State Management**: Uses useTask hook (anti-pattern - should migrate to Redux)
- **Key Features**: Timer integration, notes/links, task status management
- **Props**: projectId, onTaskStatusChange, onTaskUpdate

### Integration Points Identified:
- **Button Placement**: Adjacent to "Start Timer" button (lines 77-91)
- **State Management**: Redux DevTeam slice integration needed
- **API Extensions**: Existing task API ready for automation endpoints
- **Service Layer**: taskService.js ready for DevTeam automation functions

## Current vs. Autonomous Workflows Mapping ✅

### Current Manual Workflow:
1. Developer views TaskList component
2. Manually selects task
3. Clicks "Start Timer"
4. Manually implements task
5. Manually updates task status
6. Repeats for each task

### Planned Autonomous Workflow:
1. Developer selects customer/project
2. Clicks "Initialize Automation"
3. System ensures repo/runner setup
4. System reads task_lists.md
5. **AUTONOMOUS LOOP**:
   - Select next task
   - Execute code change workflow
   - Verify success/error
   - If error: run error-solving workflow
   - Update task_lists.md
   - Progress to next task automatically
6. Continue until all tasks complete or unresolved error
7. Developer can monitor progress across multiple customers
