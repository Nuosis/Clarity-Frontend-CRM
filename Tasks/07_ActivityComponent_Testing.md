# Financial Activity Component Integration and Testing

## Task Description
Integrate the Financial Activity component into the application, test its functionality across different contexts, and ensure it works correctly with various data scenarios. This task includes debugging any issues that arise during integration and verifying that the component meets all requirements.

## Assigned To
Debugger

## Dependencies
- Financial Activity component UI implementation
- Custom hook implementation for financial records
- Service layer implementation for financial records
- API layer implementation for financial records

## Expected Outcomes
1. Verified functionality across different timeframes and data scenarios
2. Resolved any bugs or issues
3. Confirmed performance and accessibility standards

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Scenarios
- Test with different timeframe selections (This Month, Unpaid, Last Month, This Quarter, This Year)
- Test with empty data sets
- Test with large data sets (performance testing)
- Test customer selection and project filtering
- Test chart interactions (clicking on months in line charts)
- Test record editing functionality
- Test error handling and recovery

### Performance Verification
- Verify component rendering performance
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Ensure proper data fetching and caching
- Verify memory usage and potential leaks
- Test chart rendering performance with large datasets

### Accessibility Testing
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Check screen reader compatibility
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Verify proper ARIA attributes
- Test with different screen sizes for responsive design

### Testing Process
1. Create test data for different scenarios:
   - Multiple customers with varying financial records
   - Different timeframes (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
   - Edge cases (no data, very large datasets)

2. Manually test each feature:
   - Timeframe selection
   - Chart rendering and interactions
   - Customer and project selection
   - Record editing
   - Sorting and filtering

3. Verify all requirements are met:
   - UI matches design specifications
   - Data is displayed correctly
   - Interactions work as expected
   - Performance is acceptable

4. Document any issues found and fix them

### Bug Fixing Process
1. Identify and document bugs with clear reproduction steps
2. Determine root causes through debugging
3. Implement fixes with minimal side effects
4. Verify fixes resolve the issues
5. Regression test to ensure no new issues are introduced

## Deliverables
1. Bug report and resolution documentation
2. Performance and accessibility testing report
3. Final verification that all requirements are met
4. User documentation for the Financial Activity feature
