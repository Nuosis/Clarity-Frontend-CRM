## Current Issues
1. **Initialization Flow**
   - Relies on polling for FileMaker readiness
   - No retry mechanism for failed initialization
   - No clear separation between initialization phases

2. **State Management**
   - Multiple state sources (local state, hooks)
   - Potential for state inconsistencies
   - No clear synchronization between different data types

3. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages
   - No error recovery mechanisms
   - Errors don't distinguish between different failure types

4. **Loading States**
   - Multiple loading indicators
   - No unified loading state management
   - Potential for flickering UI during transitions

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Initialization Flow
- Implement a proper initialization state machine
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Separate initialization into distinct phases:
  1. FileMaker connection
  2. User context loading
  3. Data preloading
  4. Application ready

### 2. State Management
- Create a unified state management system using context
- Implement proper synchronization between:
  - Customers
  - Projects
  - Tasks
  - Timers
- Add state versioning for consistency checks

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for different components
- Add error recovery mechanisms
- Create specific error types for:
  - Connection errors
  - Data loading errors
  - Validation errors
  - Application errors

### 4. Loading States
- Create a unified loading state manager
- Implement smooth transitions between loading states
- Add proper loading indicators for:
  - Initial loading
  - Data fetching
  - Background operations
  - User interactions

## Implementation Steps

1. Create new initialization service
2. Implement state management context
3. Add error boundary components
4. Create loading state manager
5. Refactor main component structure
6. Add proper synchronization mechanisms
7. Implement comprehensive testing

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Initialization): 2 days
- Phase 2 (State Management): 3 days
- Phase 3 (Error Handling): 1 day
- Phase 4 (Loading States): 1 day
- Phase 5 (Testing): 2 days

## Risks
- Potential breaking changes in existing components
- Need for thorough testing of synchronization
- Possible performance impact from state management
