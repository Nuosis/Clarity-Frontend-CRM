# Marketing System Wireframe Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the new marketing system structure that replaces the previous simple email campaign system. The new system is designed around a hierarchical marketing strategy framework that supports multiple domains, focused expertise areas, content pillars, and strategic content creation.

## System Architecture

### 1. Marketing Domains (Top Level)
Marketing domains represent different channels or platforms where marketing activities take place.

**Examples:**
- Email Marketing üìß
- YouTube üì∫
- LinkedIn üíº
- Twitter/X üê¶
- Instagram üì∏
- Facebook üìò

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'email',
  name: 'Email Marketing',
  icon: 'üìß',
  color: 'blue',
  focusCount: 2
}
```

### 2. Expertise/Focus Areas (Domain Level)
Each domain can have multiple focus areas that represent the overarching themes for all marketing material in that domain.

**Examples:**
- Business Efficiency
- Digital Transformation
- Process Optimization
- Technology Integration

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'business-efficiency',
  name: 'Business Efficiency',
  description: 'Streamlining operations and maximizing productivity',
  pillars: [...],
  categories: {...},
  perspectives: [...],
  contentCount: 20
}
```

### 3. Content Pillars (Focus Level)
Content pillars are the core themes that support each focus area. They provide structure and consistency to content creation.

**Examples for Business Efficiency:**
- Automation: "Streamlining repetitive tasks"
- Integration: "Connecting systems seamlessly"
- Insight: "Data-driven decision making"

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'automation',
  name: 'Automation',
  description: 'Streamlining repetitive tasks'
}
```

### 4. Content Categories (2x2 Matrix)
Based on customer mindset and motivation, content is categorized using a 2x2 matrix:

**Cognitive Space:** Emotional ‚Üî Rational
**Motivational Space:** Awareness ‚Üî Purchase

This creates four categories:

1. **Entertainment** (Emotional + Awareness)
   - Engaging, fun content that builds awareness
   - Stories, humor, relatable scenarios

2. **Inspire** (Emotional + Purchase)
   - Motivational content that drives action
   - Success stories, testimonials, aspirational content

3. **Educate** (Rational + Awareness)
   - Informational content that builds knowledge
   - How-to guides, tutorials, industry insights

4. **Convince** (Rational + Purchase)
   - Logical arguments for making a purchase
   - ROI calculations, feature comparisons, case studies

### 5. Perspective/Voice
Each focus area has a defined voice perspective:

- **Personal**: First-person, individual experiences
- **General Advice**: Broad, industry-wide guidance
- **Expert Advice**: Authoritative, specialized knowledge

### 6. Content Management
Content pieces are managed with the following statuses:

- **Published**: Live and active content
- **Scheduled**: Content planned for future release
- **In Development**: Content currently being created
- **Concept**: Ideas and concepts for future content

This structure provides a solid foundation for implementing a comprehensive marketing strategy management system that scales from simple campaigns to complex, multi-domain marketing operations.
