# DevTeam Autonomous Execution Engine - Information Hierarchy

## Executive Summary
This document defines the information hierarchy for the DevTeam Autonomous Execution Engine, prioritizing Project Manager oversight through customer-context grouping with execution phase secondary organization. The hierarchy ensures essential metrics are immediately visible while supporting scalable management of 5+ parallel customer executions.

## Hierarchy Design Principles

### Primary Organizing Principle: Customer Context
- **Customer-First Organization:** All information primarily organized by customer/client
- **Context Preservation:** Maintain customer context across all navigation and views
- **Parallel Execution Support:** Clear separation between concurrent customer executions
- **Business Impact Focus:** Prioritize business-relevant information over technical details

### Secondary Organizing Principle: Execution Phases
- **Phase-Based Grouping:** Within each customer context, organize by execution phases
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show phase overview with drill-down to detailed information
- **Dependency Visualization:** Clear indication of phase dependencies and blockers
- **Timeline Integration:** Phase information aligned with project timelines
