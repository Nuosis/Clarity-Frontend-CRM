# PRD Development Scratchpad - DevTeam Feature

## Context Review
- Project Charter reviewed: Internal Productivity Extension for Clarity CRM
- Core problem: Manual task execution workflow is tedious and disconnected from task management
- Solution: Automation workflow engine with deterministic state machine

## Key Components Identified
- Web App (React): Task visualization and control interface
- Orchestrator (Python backend): State machine for task execution
- Local Runner (Docker FastAPI): Git operations and AI tool integration
- GitHub Integration: Source of truth for tasks and documentation

## Requirements Space to Explore
- [ ] User personas and workflows
- [ ] Functional requirements by component
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
- [ ] Data models and API contracts
- [ ] UI/UX specifications
- [ ] Integration requirements
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Acceptance criteria refinement
- [ ] Constraints and assumptions

## Notes
- MVP focuses on single-repo, single-user automation
- Target: ≥50% task automation rate
- Deterministic workflow, not black-box agent
- Security: local-only execution, command allowlist
- Tools: Aider (default), Claude Code, Ollama

## PRD Completion Summary
✅ Comprehensive PRD created at ai_docs/context/core_docs/prd.md
✅ All major sections completed:
  - Executive Summary with clear problem/solution
  - Detailed user personas (Internal Developer, Project Manager)
  - Complete functional requirements (18 FRs across 3 components)
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
  - Comprehensive data models and API contracts
  - UI/UX specifications with responsive design
  - Integration requirements (GitHub, AI tools, Docker)
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Measurable acceptance criteria with KPIs
  - Implementation roadmap (5 milestones over 7 weeks)
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Key Highlights
- State machine workflow: SELECT → PREP → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → MERGE → PUSH → DONE
- Three-tier architecture: React UI, Python Orchestrator, Docker Local Runner
- Bounded error-solving loop with human escalation
- Real-time WebSocket updates and comprehensive logging
- Security-first approach with command allowlists and Docker isolation
- Measurable success criteria: 50% automation rate, 30% cycle time reduction
