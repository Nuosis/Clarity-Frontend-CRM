**Dependencies:** Identify critical functions in src/services, src/api, and src/hooks.  
**Assigned to:** Coder.  
**Expected Outcome:** Improved maintainability and easier onboarding for new developers.

## Task 4: Optimize Context Providers and Custom Hooks for Performance
**Goal:** Audit and optimize the usage of React context and custom hooks to avoid unnecessary re-renders.  
**Dependencies:** Review of state management in src/context and src/hooks.  
**Assigned to:** Architect for design, Coder for implementation.  
**Expected Outcome:** Improved application performance with proper memoization strategies.
