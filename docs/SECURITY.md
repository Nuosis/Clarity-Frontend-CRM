# Security Guidelines

## Overview

ClarityFrontend CRM handles sensitive customer and project data, requiring robust security measures. This document outlines security practices, potential vulnerabilities, and protection measures.

## Authentication & Authorization

### FileMaker Authentication
- Credentials stored in environment variables
- No hardcoding of credentials in source code
- Session management through fm-gofer
- Automatic session renewal
- Connection timeout handling

### Access Control
- Layout-based access control through FileMaker
- Role-based permissions
- Field-level security
- Action-based authorization
- Session validation on all requests

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data
Protected information includes:
- Customer contact details
- Project information
- Task descriptions
- Time records
- Financial data
- Staff information

### Data Storage
1. Environment Variables
   - Stored in `.env` file
   - Not committed to version control
   - Separate configurations for development/production

2. Local Storage
   - Only non-sensitive UI preferences stored
   - No credentials or business data cached
   - Regular cleanup of temporary data

3. FileMaker Data
   - Encrypted at rest
   - Secure transmission
   - Regular backups
   - Access logging

## Communication Security

### API Security
1. Request Validation
   - Parameter sanitization
   - Type checking
   - Required field validation
   - Query injection prevention

2. Response Security
   - Data filtering
   - Error message sanitization
   - No sensitive data in stack traces
   - Structured error responses

### Network Security
1. HTTPS Requirements
   - Secure connection required
   - TLS 1.2 or higher
   - Certificate validation
   - HSTS implementation

2. FileMaker Connection
   - Encrypted communication
   - Connection pooling
   - Timeout handling
   - Retry with backoff

## Vulnerability Prevention

### Common Vulnerabilities
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Input sanitization
   - Content Security Policy
   - Output encoding
   - React's built-in XSS protection

2. SQL Injection
   - Parameter validation
   - Prepared statements in FileMaker
   - Input sanitization
   - Query structure validation

3. CSRF Protection
   - Token validation
   - Same-origin policy
   - Request validation
   - Session verification

### Code Security
1. Dependencies
   - Regular security updates
   - Dependency auditing
   - Version control
   - Vulnerability scanning

2. Error Handling
   - Secure error logging
   - No sensitive data in errors
   - Graceful failure handling
   - User-friendly error messages

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
